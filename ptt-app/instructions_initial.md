# How to use the application


## License
Distributed under a GPLv3+ license. 

NB Stojic's code didn't include a license, so I've included this for safety. 
NNB cannot use MIT license as the scripts call on several GPL packages.

The application was written in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) programming language, and deployed with the help of R package [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). 

Code is available at [Github](https://github.com/hstojic/perfect-t-test-app) under some licence.
