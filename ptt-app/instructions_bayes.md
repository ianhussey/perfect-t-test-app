For the Bayes Factor, specify which effect you expect. Standard to 0.5 (small effect). Change to 0.707 (medium effect) or 1 (large effect).

(Ian NB - to my knowledge, this variable does not specify the expected effect size, but the scaling factor of the cauchy distribution that is placed on the prior, which is centred on zero by default.)
